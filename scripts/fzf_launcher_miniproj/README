                  --- bash-isms -----
    Use #!/usr/bin/env bash, since you're using bash-isms like arrays, [[, and export -f.
    In bash (not POSIX sh), you can read the contents of a file to a variable without abusing cat: contents=$(< file)
    Use shellcheck to catch other gotchas. (You can paste the script there, or install shellcheck locally and run shellcheck ascript.sh.)
